## UNethology 🐚: Exploring UNet Applications 🧬

Welcome to **UNethology**, a repository dedicated to showcasing the versatility of UNet, a powerful deep learning architecture for image segmentation and beyond. In this repository, I delve into my journey of utilizing UNet to tackle a variety of problems, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in various domains.

**Recent Update: April 15, 2024** 🏆

I'm excited to share my latest conquest in the realm of UNet applications! I've successfully employed UNet to tackle a regression prediction challenge on Kaggle, specifically [predicting the age of abalones](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4). If you're curious to see how I harnessed UNet's power for this task, check out my Kaggle notebook: [UNethology: Predict Age with UNet???](https://www.kaggle.com/code/liaoguoying/unethology-predict-age-with-unet).

**Stay tuned for more UNet adventures!** 🚀

As I continue my exploration of UNet's capabilities, I'll be adding more projects and insights to this repository. Feel free to follow along and join me on this exciting journey of UNet-powered problem-solving! 🤓
