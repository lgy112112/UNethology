## UNethology üêö: Exploring UNet Applications üß¨

Welcome to **UNethology**, a repository dedicated to showcasing the versatility of UNet, a powerful deep learning architecture for image segmentation and beyond. In this repository, I delve into my journey of utilizing UNet to tackle a variety of problems, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in various domains.

**Recent Updates:** üèÜ

* **May 6, 2024:** Added a new project demonstrating UNet for medical image segmentation on the SMU Dataset. Check out the notebook: [SMU Dataset: UNet for Medical Image Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/liaoguoying/smu-dataset-dl-update-with-new-dataset). In this project, I use smp to construct ViT-based UNet to compare with ResUNet. Plus, [a novel loss function](https://github.com/lgy112112/DiceCELossWithKL) is applied.

* **April 15, 2024:** Successfully employed UNet to tackle a regression prediction challenge on Kaggle, specifically [predicting the age of abalones](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4). See the Kaggle notebook: [UNethology: Predict Age with UNet???](https://www.kaggle.com/code/liaoguoying/unethology-predict-age-with-unet).

**Stay tuned for more UNet adventures!** üöÄ

As I continue my exploration of UNet's capabilities, I'll be adding more projects and insights to this repository. Feel free to follow along and join me on this exciting journey of UNet-powered problem-solving! ü§ì

**Projects:**

* **SMU Dataset: UNet for Medical Image Segmentation** - Demonstrates UNet for segmenting medical images from the SMU Dataset, showcasing its potential in medical image analysis. 
* **UNethology: Predict Age with UNet???** - A Kaggle notebook demonstrating how UNet can be adapted for regression prediction tasks, specifically predicting the age of abalones.
