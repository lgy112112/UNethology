## UNethology üêö: Exploring UNet Applications üß¨

Welcome to **UNethology**, a repository dedicated to showcasing the versatility of UNet, a powerful deep learning architecture for image segmentation and beyond. In this repository, I delve into my journey of utilizing UNet to tackle a variety of problems, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in various domains.

**Recent Updates:** üèÜ

* **November 5, 2024:** [A new notebook](Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_UNet/how_to_visualize_features_map.ipynb) guiding you how to visualize feature map via hook function.

* **November 4, 2024:** Introduced a comprehensive Jupyter notebook detailing the training process of UNet for brain tumor segmentation on MRI images. This notebook covers data loading, dataset and dataloader creation, model setup with MONAI's BasicUNet, and the training pipeline using PyTorch Lightning. The project highlights the integration of UNet with advanced medical imaging frameworks for precise segmentation tasks. You can get data via [Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_UNet/data_get.ipynb](Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_UNet/data_get.ipynb), 
train in [Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_UNet/train.ipynb](Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_UNet/train.ipynb). This project is the most detailed-detailed-ever one including how to assess model, plotting results. I will update this part in the following days.
 
* **May 6, 2024:** Added a new project demonstrating UNet for medical image segmentation on the SMU Dataset. Check out the notebook: [SMU Dataset: UNet for Medical Image Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/liaoguoying/smu-dataset-dl-update-with-new-dataset). In this project, I use smp to construct ViT-based UNet to compare with ResUNet. Plus, [a novel loss function](https://github.com/lgy112112/DiceCELossWithKL) is applied.

* **April 15, 2024:** Successfully employed UNet to tackle a regression prediction challenge on Kaggle, specifically [predicting the age of abalones](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4). See the Kaggle notebook: [UNethology: Predict Age with UNet???](https://www.kaggle.com/code/liaoguoying/unethology-predict-age-with-unet).

**Stay tuned for more UNet adventures!** üöÄ

As I continue my exploration of UNet's capabilities, I'll be adding more projects and insights to this repository. Feel free to follow along and join me on this exciting journey of UNet-powered problem-solving! ü§ì

**Projects:**
